# Algorithm & Data Structure
This repository includes some basic algorithms associated with data strucutres. Mainly in c or c++.
## Data Structure
### Using Google Test
To use Google test under this subdirectory:
1. Create a direcotory called "lib": ```mkdir lib```
2. Go to lib directory: ```cd lib```
3. Clone google test from Github: ```git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git```
4. Create a direcotory called "build": ```mkdir ../build```
5. Go to build directory: ```cd ../build```
6. Build configuration: ```cmake ..```
7. Compile & Run: ```make && ./Data_Structure```
